# utils

Utility functions exist to make our lives easier. For instance, if you find yourself repeatedly munging data a certain way, you could extract that into a utility function.


setup.sql
Add a test for a route
Add your controller file to app.js
Controller / Model -- these kind of go in tandem
Repeat steps 1-4 multiple times
Index in public
Define index path in app
